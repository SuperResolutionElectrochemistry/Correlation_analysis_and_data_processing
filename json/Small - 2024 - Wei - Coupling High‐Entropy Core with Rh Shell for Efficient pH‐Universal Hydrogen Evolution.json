    "reaction_mechanism": "The core-shell structure enhances the interaction between Rh shell and PtCoNiMoRh core, reducing the unoccupied Rh 4d states (especially 4d₅/₂). This optimizes H* adsorption/desorption and facilitates H₂O dissociation. DFT shows Rh 4d orbitals shift with shell thickness, and the H* adsorption energy is more favorable for PtCoNiMoRh@Rh with 1 ML shell."
